                <p>
                    The UCSC Rocket Team has a rich history competing in rocektry competitions since it's founding in
                    2017.
                    The team has previously competed in the NASA USLI competition, where it has placed high and even won
                    awards for outstanding design and sportsmanship in 2018, 2019, and 2021.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beginning in 2024, the team has taken the step up to the International Rocketry Engineering
                    Challenge, formerly known as Spaceport America. Over 150 teams compete annually in what is widely
                    considered one of the largest and most prestigious competitions in the world.
