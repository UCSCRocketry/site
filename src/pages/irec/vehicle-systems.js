                        <h6>Overview</h6>
                        <p>
                            The Vehicle Systems Team leads the design, manufacturing, and testing
                            of the main launch vehicle, including critical components like the
                            airframe, fins, and propulsion system. Our team prioritizes structural
                            integrity, propulsion efficiency, and overall flight readiness throughout
                            each stage of the design and building process.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We are also responsible for designing and implementing the rocketâ€™s
                            recovery system to ensure a safe descent and recovery after flight.
                            This includes preparing ejection charges for each separation event,
                            determining optimal parachute sizing, and analyzing flight data. Utilizing
                            OpenRocket flight software, we examine how factors such as altitude,
                            wind conditions, descent rate, and stability impact the rocket performance
                            during flight.
                        </p>
                        <h6>Recovery</h6>
                        <p>
                            The Recovery Subteam is a specialized branch of the Vehicle Team focused on designing,
                            testing, and implementing systems to ensure the safe return of rocket components
                            post-flight. Our primary objective is to minimize damage during descent and landing,
                            enabling the reuse of critical components and enhancing overall mission sustainability.
