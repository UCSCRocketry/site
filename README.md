## Hey!

My name is Aaron Spalding, and I am the main developer for the website.


This website was originally created in Fall of 2024 to meet the new needs 
of the Rocket Team and giving it the refreshing look it needs. Hopefully, 
as there was when I was here, there will be a web development team that 
constantly improves on the website. If somehow development ceases after I
graduate, I'm happy to answer any questions or even help fix the site in any way.

Feel free to reach out to me over slack, or my email, aaronspalding59@gmail.com
